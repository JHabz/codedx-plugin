<div>
    <p>
        This field lets you choose which Code Dx branch you would like the analysis to run on.
        This does <b>not</b> need to match your repository or code branch name.
        By default, Code Dx will run an analysis on the <pre><code>DEFAULT</code></pre> branch.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use build/environment variables to construct a different name for each analysis. For a git project on branch <pre><code>fix-parameters</code></pre>:
        <pre><code>${GIT_BRANCH}</code></pre>
        would start an analysis for Code Dx branch.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the entered branch does not exist, Code Dx will create it if the analysis is successful.
        If the analysis fails, no new branch will be created or saved.
    </p>
