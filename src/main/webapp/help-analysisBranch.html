<div>
    <p>
        This field lets you choose which Code Dx branch you would like the analysis to run on.
        This does <b>not</b> need to match your repository or code branch name.
        By default, Code Dx will run an analysis on the <code>DEFAULT</code> branch.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use build/environment variables to construct the chosen branch for each analysis. For a git project on branch <code>fix-parameters</code>:
        <code>${GIT_BRANCH}</code>
        would start an analysis for Code Dx branch <code>fix-parameters</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the entered branch does not exist, Code Dx will create it if the analysis is successful as long as the parent is specified.
        If the analysis fails, no new branch will be created or saved.
    </p>
